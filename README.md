Year 3: Advanced programming techniques, algorithm theory, data science methodologies, and practical applications of AI, including generative intelligence and prompting strategies with tools like ChatGPT.

# Learning Methods:
The course combines lectures, hands-on programming exercises, collaborative projects, and real-world applications to ensure a well-rounded learning experience. Students will engage in problem-solving and critical thinking exercises that promote a deeper understanding of the material.

# Prerequisites:
No prior programming experience is required, though a willingness to learn and explore new concepts is essential.

# Tools used
To follow the course, you can use a personal laptop.
In this case, you need to install the **Anaconda Navigator** suite on your laptop (downloadable from the website https://www.anaconda.com/download). For the installation you can follow the video instructions published on the classroom website of the course (see below) or viewable on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mo3EP4Hy-k&t=115s

Those who do not have a personal laptop can use the laptops of the computer lab. The environment used is **Google Colab** which can be used with a browser (Chrome for example) from any PC, directly from the address https://colab.research.google.com/

To access Colab you need to have a **Google account** (those who do not have one can create one from the site https://www.google.com/intl/it/account/about/). Once you have created the Google user, log in to verify access to the environment.

To import notebooks into Colab you need to have a **GitHub account**. If you do not have one, you can create it from the website https://github.com/join

**REMEMBER** to bring with you to the computer lab **UID and PWD to access Google and GitHub**.

# Google Classroom work environment
